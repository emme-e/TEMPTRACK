... shows the layout for the folder everything is in
ps. didn't add all the files 

ultimate aim of our project...
to model the temperture change

to do:

adding to the models folder
- define more functions for other kinds of heat transfer... should be in the same folder as newtons_law_of_cooling
  - Fourierâ€™s Law of Heat Conduction (for solids)
  - radiative heat transfer (eg.ovens, sunlight..)
      - could do the colour thing
  

add to the newtons_law_of_cooling
-i dont know if the below is possible, but i think it would be cool.
might just be a question of importing a bunch of numbers for the temperature of container over... time
 - another way of calculating... so import lots of real world data for a particular container and use this to calculate newtons_law of cooling
      - will also need to create a some sort of system to get rid of outliers
  

adding to the simulation folder:
- a graph showing the temperature change over time
- calculating the temperature of some object/container over ...time
- calculaitng the time taken for some temperature change
- compare our models to real life values create a null + alternative hypthesis to see whether or the model should be accepted
    - have a graph comparing the two?
