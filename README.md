... shows the layout for the folder everything is in
ps. didn't add all the files...

ultimate aim of our project...
to model the temperture change


please put your initals next to the thing you are working next to, and feel free to add anything you want to work on
remember to import previous files into other files so its all connected (if need be)
to do:

adding to the models folder
- define more functions for other kinds of heat transfer... should be in the same folder as newtons_law_of_cooling
  - Fourierâ€™s Law of Heat Conduction (for solids)
  - radiative heat transfer (eg.ovens, sunlight..)
      - could do the colour thing
  

add to the newtons_law_of_cooling
-i dont know if the below is possible, but i think it would be cool.
might just be a question of importing a bunch of numbers for the temperature of container over... time
 - another way of calculating... so import lots of real world data for a particular container and use this to calculate newtons_law of cooling
      - will also need to create a some sort of system to get rid of outliers
  

adding to the simulation folder:
-EE a graph showing the temperature change over time
-EE calculating the temperature of some object/container over ...time
-EE calculaitng the time taken for some temperature change
- compare our models to real life values create a null + alternative hypthesis to see whether or the model should be accepted
    - have a graph comparing the two?
