ultimate aim of our project...
to model the temperture change of different containers in different enviorments

my modeling this can mean:
- graph of... the temperature change of a specific container in a specific enviorment
- use the models to calculate the likely temperature at a specific time
-   compare our model to real-life data... eg. have a null hypothesis... this would allow us to see whether or not we should accept our model
